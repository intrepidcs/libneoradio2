Installation
============================================================

module can be installed by simply running the following command:

``pip install neoradio2``

    **Windows Note:** pip.exe is usually located under the Scripts directory under the Python
    installation directory.
    
    **Linux Note:** A lot of distributions have Python 2 and 3 installed side by side. As of this writing without a version suffix the commands still default to version 2 of the Python binaries. In order to utilize the Python 3 binaries you must append a 3 after the binary names (python3 and pip3 instead of just python and pip).
